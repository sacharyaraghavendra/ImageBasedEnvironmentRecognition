# ImageBasedEnvironmentRecognition
Type A â€“ Research Oriented Study on Sound generation for Images based on environment  recognition

A Research by Raghavendra Sreenivas Acharya and Kaustubh Raval, CSU Sacramento

In this Project we have created CNN models for scene detection. Dataset Links can be found in the report. We have refined the Dataset to a smaller dataset where 6 scene types are shortlisted. After Data preprocessing, we are loading the pre processing to a pickle file for easy access. The data is run with 6 different CNN models to finalize the best model.
